    <h3>Yeast Bread Pizza Crust</h3>
    <p>This pizza crust recipe was given to me by a friend. It is quick, easy and delicious!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>2 cup bread flour, 1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a small bowl. Let stand until creamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine bread flour, olive oil, sugar, salt, and yeast mixture in a mixing bowl; stir well to combine. Beat until a stiff dough has formed.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a well-floured surface. Form dough into a round and roll out into a thin crust.</li>
        <li>Bake pizza in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly and crust is golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
